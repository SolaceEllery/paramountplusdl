# paramountplusdl
A GUI version of yt-dlp to download content from Paramount+. This works with Windows only, by the way.

# How do I download this?
Check the releases tab for the latest version. For nightly's they'll be here on the source code.

To work the downloader you'll need yt-dlp and ffmpeg on the root of the batch or else it won't work.
